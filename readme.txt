== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can the redirect be instantaneous? =

You can set the wait time to 0 seconds, but by doing that people probably will not see your exit warning or advertisement.

= Can the text be styled? =

If you know CSS the text the shortcode outputs is inside a div with the class wpexitcode. You should be able to style the div and text how you want.

= Does this plugin create the exit page for me? =

No, this plugin makes it possible to redirect from the page/post you create in WordPress.
